# Generative AI Frustration

It pains me to see how apparently the entire tech industry went into a mode of lying and deceiving about generative AI and it's impact on jobs and the world. After all the metaverse bullshit and the web3 scams, now everyone and his mom has jumped onto the gen-ai hype train and is pulling the most useless applications out of their magic hats. Almost nothing of that has any real value or works reliably enough to be usable in production, but everyone makes sure to claim broadly that this will replace all the jobs. And while doing so, the honest work of creators all around the world is blatantly stolen to continue feeding this pipe dream.

While billions are poured into already doomed companies that are not solving any real problem except for being investable in this AI bubble, companies building actually valuable products for their customers and taking data privacy and ownership seriously are having a harder and harder time to get funding and stay afloat. This is not the tech industry I once loved .. it hasn't been for a while, but it was never as bad as now.

The only jobs that could be replaced by gen-ai in the foreseeable future are actually of these CEOs hyping this up further to justify and elevate their crazy valuations that are completely detached from reality. After all, the only skills required for this are eloquence and confidence, which is one of the few things gen-ai is reliably good at.

Just think about how much money companies could save by replacing the Altmans, Musks and Pichais with an LLM. :)

Actually, thinking about that, I'm open to take 10M$ seed funding for my new GenAI-Executive startup (I call it CAIO or GenX-ecutive) and I will replace your CEO with an LLM within the next 6 month. Any takers? Sam? Sundar? anyone? hit me up ... :D
