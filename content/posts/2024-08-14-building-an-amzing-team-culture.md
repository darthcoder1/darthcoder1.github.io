# Building an Amazing Team Culture

In 2019, I have embarked on the journey of co-founding a startup and leading the technical and product development as the CTO. In this time, we hired ~30 employees, most of them in the engieering department spread across multiple functions. I went into this adventure with the firm goal to build an inclusive, honest and enjoyable team culture. One that I would love to work in myself, regardless of position and seniority.

In retrospect I think it is fair to say that this approach was absolutely succefull and has resulted not only in the best working environment and the best team I had ever the pleasure to work with, but also in gaining some of the best and dearest friends I am still regularly in touch with.

When I talk about a great team culture, this refers to the following key points, which I will go into more detail further down.

- trust your team members
- be transparent and honest
- support each other
- make independent decisions
- be accountable
- be pragmatic

Building a team culture is never easy and it does not happen by sharing a document during onboarding, but by living according to it every day. Lead by example. The culture you have is not the one you want, but the one that the team experiences and lives every day. One of the main actions must be to always to act yourself in the same way you would expect your team to act.
You want honesty? Then be honest and transparent. You want accountability? Be accountable yourself.

It might feel tough to be transparent and honest as a company founder, especially when it comes to sharing financials, run-dry and other key metrics. If it feels wrong to you, shake that feeling. Shake it now. Loyality goes both ways. If you expect your employees to be loyal, be also loyal. That means also to share bad news or hard truths and treat your team as adults that can (and will) make their own decisions based on their own risk conciesness. We have been completely open about everything company related, about the financials, the struggles and the wins. This built a form of trust that enabled and encouraged everyone in the team to operate with the same honesty and transparency. In the end this was one of the key success factors of this outstanding team.

Another important point is to not hire for skill only, but to hire for cultural fit and motivation first, skill second. An outstanding developer that does not fit your teams culture and creates tension within an otherwise good functioning team will in the end do more harm than good. A great cultural fit with some lack in experience or skills in specific areas will be pulled up by the team, will learn and adapt fast and in return also lift up it's team. People are willing to learn and they love it, when they can do it in a supportive environment. Your job is to create this environment and everything else will fall into place.

Further down, I have an excerpt of the Team DNA onboarding document (ahhh, the irony, right :D) we used at Yaak. But as I mentioned, this was not the only place this culture was advertised. It was advertised every day in every interaction by just living according to it. But to give credit where credit is due, this document was insipired heavilly by the team culture I experienced at Unity during the time I was there. It has showcased clearly that an inclusive, supportive and open culture is in fact possible and yields outstanding results. While a lot has change over at Unity since my time there, this is not the place to go deeper into that ... maybe in another post.

I am sharing this mainly to encourage you to try to move your culture into a similar direction, as the results where even better then I have hoped for. We managed to deliver all of our milestones on time and without crunch time and crazy overtime. And all of this with a highly complicated product consisting of custom hardware integrated with cars, a custom embedded software stack, cloud services, a mobile app and a VR driving simulator. So, kind of 5 startups in one and the team of one. Delivering on all of this was not an easy and simple task, but the way the teams worked together, supported each other and stood up for each other was one of the most serene experiences I ever had in work life. And it turned out to be extremly successfull when it came to delivery of products and features. Whenver someone was struggling or had issues, it was communicated in time and others stepped in to help and made sure that the critical path to delivery was paved.

With this being said, I leave you now to the DNA document excerpt I mentioned. I hope you can take away something from this post and bring that to your company. I am quite confident you will be very surprised by how powerfull and efficient a team operating in such a mode can be. Feel free to get in touch with questions and comments.

## Team DNA

We want to build a team with people from different disciplines, with different views, backgrounds and experiences but work together as one.

### Intro

Due to COVID19, we have been forced to work as a distributed team since day one. The following document outlines what we strive towards when we build the team.

A key reason why we have succeeded even during lockdowns is because:

- All teams have atleast 1 really senior contributor, that has bandwidth to guide and coach their peers.
- All decision making processes, meetings, peer reviews, workshops, and informal conversations are organized in a way that does not favor physical precense in a meeting. This enforced through:
  - Meetings are conducted on personal hardware. Not in meeting rooms
  - Team members can review meeting notes and understand, request clarrification or challenge the decisions, regardless of seniority.
  - All team members are willing to learn and grow

We share the same vision and want to reach the same goal. There should be no silos and everyone is encouraged to support or challenge the decisions and ideas of their team members. If someone is struggling to solve a problem, help each other. There is no "my area, your area". There is just our Yaak and we want to help each other, trust each other and take advantage of the smart people from different areas to ship an outstanding product.

Our team learns every day, every problem we solve gives us new knowledge, opens new possibilities. Everyone in the team does not only support the project and work towards its success, but also supports each other in professional and private success. This means, learning from each other, teaching each other, generally helping each other and also pushing each other boundaries. Mutual respect is the default mode of operation and we take into account the personality traits of other team members (ex.: if a rather quiet person has a great idea but struggles pitching it, we want the team to help with that, support their team member to bring their ideas to fruition).

Building a great team with great people must also focus on their needs, and developers of the caliber we want, are more motivated by learning opportunities, interesting challenges and meaningful impact, rather than be a few bucks more or less on the bank account (this obviously assumes competitive salaries in the first place). They are also easily frustrated if processes are forced onto them that do not positively impact their work. For this, we have to find a balance and establish processes that help us deliver an outstanding product, while ditching processes that are just in our way.

We are in this together! No bullshit, no shying away from problems, no ego rampages!

### Trust your team members

Every member of the team is an expert and knows their area. Never think of others as not having a clue, but instead as someone that bases their decision on data known and relevant to them, maybe not to you. A decision you disagree with has not been made because of incompetence, but because of different information density and filtering. If you disagree, talk to each other, lay down the data that leads to a specific decision and see if different viewpoints should be taken into account or can influence the decision. This helps foster trust and also to bring expertise from different fields together to come up with the best solution given the available data. This is also the mode of working that allows for most knowledge sharing, as mentoring does not become a top-down thing, but happens as equals.

### Be open and honest

Every team member is encouraged to give their opinion, voice their views and influence the decision making process. Everyone is an important part in reaching the goals and must have the safety to be able to raise honest concerns and speak about problems. Failure is part of the process.
When things go wrong, each team member must feel safe to communicate the problems and understand that they will not be "punished", but find support instead. If something goes wrong, the team needs to know it as early as possible to be able to react. A failure should not be a problem of a single team member, but of the entire team. Mistakes and errors are not a reason to blame, but a reason to help.

### Support each other

No silos, we’re aiming towards the same goal. While everyone has a main duty and main responsibilities, the most important responsibility is the project and getting the platform forward. Interdisciplinary support needs to be at the core of the team. If one area struggles, others are encouraged to jump in and help, even if that means they have to learn new things.

### Be Independent and make decisions

We want to build a company where people feel comfortable making independent decisions. Think of decisions as Type 1 and Type 2 decisions. Type 1 are not easily reversible, and you have to be very careful making them. Type 2 decisions are like walking through a door — if you don't like the decision, you can always go back. We can make as many mistakes in Type 2 decisions as we want. It might require code refactoring time. No need to require large rounds of feedback from all parties on a google doc before implementing. Collect requirements from primary stakeholders, implement, iterate. Documenting why discussions were made is good practice.

As general rule of thumb: Ask for forgiveness, not for permission.

### Be Accountable

Be accountable for what you do. If there are problems, raise them. If things go well, advocate them. Everyone is here to support the bigger picture, therefore we must keep our promises and support others in keeping theirs. Keeping promises does not mean working harder, but working smarter. Recognizing problems early on and requesting help is encouraged and part of how we want to operate. Analyze what went wrong, so every failure is a chance to learn and improve.

### Be Pragmatic

We are developers and are trying to solve a problem. If there is a problem, solve it. Do not abstract it away until you can solve another problem, which you’ve created by your own abstractions. Code is written to transform data, that is its main purpose. So, design your data and write code that does exactly what is required. Everytime code is written, it must solve the problem at hand or build a road to solve that problem. Never write code just for the sake of writing code. This might seem obvious but really is far away from that. We are not building code castles to look at and be proud of, we are writing code that will fuel the future of autonomy, so make every line count.
