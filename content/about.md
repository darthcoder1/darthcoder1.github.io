# About

I am Martin Zielinski, software engineer and tech enthusiast. For more than 20 years, I'm working in software engineering in different capacities. A large portion of that was working on games and game engines, but recently I also co-founded a startup in the space of autonomous driving, which I have left beginning of this year. Currently I am doing contracting gigs in different areas, but specifically in game development and advisory.

### Game Development Projects

This is a list of (shipped) projects I've worked on

- [Unity Engine](https://unity.com) (as Core Foundation R&D @ [Unity](https://unity.com))
- [Dead Island 2](https://deadisland.com) (as Principle Software Engineer @ [Yager Development](https://yager.de))
- [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) (as Senior Engineer @ [Epic Games UK](https://www.epicgames.com/site/de/home))
- [Spec Ops : The Line](https://2k.com/en-US/game/spec-ops-the-line/) (as Lead Console Programer @ [Yager Development](https://yager.de))
- [Paraworld](https://www.myabandonware.com/game/paraworld-f3y) (as Programer @ [SEK-OST](https://www.mobygames.com/company/2678/spieleentwicklungskombinat-gmbh/))

### Other Projects

- Simulation for development of autonomous driving @ Daimler Autonomous
- Meltemi, mobile operating system @ Nokia

### Yaak Technologies

As Co-Founder and CTO at [Yaak](www.yaak.ai), I had an amazing but also intense time. I have probably learned more in these 4 years than in the 15 before. Yaak's mission is to develop an AI model that can measure and objectively quantify the safety of any given driving maneuver. For that, we developed a custom hardware kit that integrated with a car and was able to collect all relevent vehicle telemetry and also contained 8 cameras to record a 360 degree view around the vehicle as well as other sensors. This, together with a mobile app to be used by driving instructors, a platform to ingest and work with the data and a VR driving simulator for student training made up the product offering, which got quite a lot of traction in the industry and allowed Yaak to collect highly relevant training data for the AI goals.
I am mostly proud about the insanely talented team and the amazing work culture we built, but more on that soon :)
